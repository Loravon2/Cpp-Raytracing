# Examples
The project supports multiple example inputs, that can be found in the `examples` directory. They serve as reference to create your own .json input files, as well as a simple way to test that the build works as expected.

## example1.json
This is the example given by Thibaut Lunet as illustration example. It should ouput a gray, crumbly sphere.
